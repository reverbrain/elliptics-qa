# how to handle hash defined in several places
# hash can be merged, or replaced
# if you use replace, and have multiple hashes named 'x', the last defined
# will override the previously defined one
# if you use merge here, hash will cumulate their keys, but keys will still
# override each other
# replace is the default value, and is how ansible always handled hash variables
#
# hash_behaviour=replace

# How to handle variable replacement - as of 1.2, Jinja2 variable syntax is
# preferred, but we still support the old $variable replacement too.
# If you change legacy_playbook_variables to no then Ansible will no longer
# try to do replacement on $variable style variables.
#
# legacy_playbook_variables=yes

# if you need to use jinja2 extensions, you can list them here
# use a coma to separate extensions, e.g. :
# jinja2_extensions=jinja2.ext.do,jinja2.ext.i18n
# no extensions are loaded by default

#jinja2_extensions=

# if set, always use this private key file for authentication, same as if passing
# --private-key to ansible or ansible-playbook

# format of string $ansible_managed available within Jinja2 templates, replacing
# {file}, {host} and {uid} with template filename, host and owner respectively.
# The resulting string is passed through strftime(3) so it may contain any
# time-formatting specifiers.
#
# Example: ansible_managed = DONT TOUCH {file}: call {uid} at {host} for changes
ansible_managed = Ansible managed: {file} modified on %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S by {uid} on {host}
